# platform-code-test

A live coding to test for potential platform engineers.

## Requirements

* [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)

## Setup

AWS creds need to be setup outside of this repo, a simple way is to use env vars like so (sample file - [.aws_creds](.aws_creds)):

```BASH
# File w/Access Keys
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_REGION="eu-west-1"
```

Then you can source this file before running any commands.

### S3 State Bucket

An S3 bucket is required to store state in, this must be created manually, please see the provider files ([here](terraform/environments/common/providers.tf) and [here](terraform/environments/production/providers.tf)) for the bucket name.

## Usage

### How to Provision Pre-Interview

Before an interview (at least half an hour before) the following actions should be performed:

* Clone this repo
* Setup CLI creds
* Apply production infra - ```make tf-apply```

Post interview everything should be taken down:

* Destroy like so - ```make tf-destroy```

### Makefile

A simple [Makefile](Makefile) is provided for running some common commands:

```BASH
# Run terraform plan, runs against production by default
make tf-plan
# Run terraform apply
make tf-apply
# Run terraform cmds against the common env
make tf-plan ENV=common
make tf-apply ENV=common
# Destroy production post interview
make tf-destroy
```

## Environments

### Production

This is where the candidate will be working during the test, it should be destroyed and recreated between tests.

### Common

This contains resources that should persist between tests, will need to be applied before the production env
